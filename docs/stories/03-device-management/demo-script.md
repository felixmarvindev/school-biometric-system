# Story 03: Device Management - Demo Script

## Demo Overview

**Duration**: 4-5 minutes  
**Goal**: Show device registration and monitoring capabilities

## Demo Flow

### 1. Register Device (1.5 minutes)
- Show device registration form
- Fill device information
- Test connection (or show simulation)
- Show device in list

### 2. Device Status (1 minute)
- Show real-time status indicators
- Explain online/offline states
- Show last-seen timestamps
- Show device capacity

### 3. Device Groups (1 minute)
- Create device group
- Assign devices to group
- Filter by group
- Explain organization benefits

### 4. Simulation Mode (1 minute)
- Toggle simulation mode
- Show devices appear online
- Explain demo capabilities
- Show how it enables testing

## Key Talking Points

- "Devices are registered once and monitored continuously"
- "Real-time status ensures admins know device health"
- "Device groups organize by location or purpose"
- "Simulation mode enables demos without hardware"
