# Phase 4: Simulation Mode

## Goal

Enable demo and testing mode without requiring physical ZKTeco devices.

## Duration Estimate

2-3 days

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Phase 3 complete (device monitoring working)

## Technical Components

### Backend Changes

- [ ] Create simulated device interface
- [ ] Add simulation mode toggle
- [ ] Implement simulated device responses
- [ ] Add environment variable for simulation mode

### Frontend Changes

- [ ] Add simulation mode toggle UI
- [ ] Show simulation mode indicator
- [ ] Update device list for simulation mode

## Visual Checkpoints

- [ ] Simulation mode toggle visible
- [ ] Devices show as online in simulation mode
- [ ] Simulated responses work correctly
- [ ] Clear indication when in simulation mode

## Story Complete

This completes Story 03: Device Management. Devices can now be:
- ✅ Registered and managed
- ✅ Organized into groups
- ✅ Monitored in real-time
- ✅ Simulated for demos

**Next Story**: Story 04: Automated Enrollment - The killer feature!
